# PC-O-Meter v2.1
## Automagical PC-O-Meter for the SSE Lab.

Uses a servo, some buttons, and some [Particle Photons](https://www.particle.io/) to indicate the current "political correct-ness" of the lab.

On each table, there is a large red button. When the button is pressed, the needle on the PC-O-Meter rises by a given amount, indicating that the lab has become less "PC" at that moment. After a cool-down period, the needle slowly lowers back to the baseline value.
